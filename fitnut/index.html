					<h1>Fitness and Nutrition</h1>
					<h2>All Work. And All Play.</h2>
						SCOPE Fitness and Nutrition is a health education program teaching fitness and nutrition to 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders in Los Angeles. The programâ€™s main goal is to improve health outcomes by educating children on how to stay healthy by eating nutritious foods and staying physically active. In addition, we are dedicated to raising awareness on the social determinants of health and encouraging our students to become active members in their communities.			
						<br><br>
						At the same time, Fitness and Nutrition teachers gain valuable leadership skills and knowledge about the community, its health barriers, and burdens. Fitness and Nutrition teachers will gain teaching skills, learn about childhood health, fitness and nutrition, and most importantly, build a positive and invaluable relationship with the community.

				<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
				<div id="slide-show_text">
					Opened in the Summer of 2003, SCOPE established itself as a child and family resource center at the UCLA 200 Medical Plaza in the waiting room of the Children's Health Center.  SCOPE came about when medical students, public health graduate and undergraduate students saw that there was a need to provide more comprehensive care to its patients and their families.   
					<br><br>
					Advised by Alice Kuo M.D. Ph.D. M.Ed., a pediatric physician and Todd Franke Ph.D., professor of Social Welfare, SCOPE bridges the health access gap between medicine and the public's overall health.  It is also an educational tool for students and pediatric residents to learn about their community, its health, barriers, burdens and the resources it provides.
